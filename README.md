# ResourcePack"Decryptor"

A simple tool to unpack corrupted zip files commonly used to "encrypt" Minecraft resource packs with tools like PackSquash.
 This is a proof of concept to show how easily those files can be unpacked. It's not intended to support real zip file
 encryption or some weird ways of corrupting zip files not targeting Minecraft resource packs. 

This program basically uses the same method as the Minecraft client to unpack the files.
 (Which honestly is [quite simple](https://github.com/Phoenix616/ResourcePackDecryptor/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/phoenix616/rpdecryptor/Main.java#L83-L95))

My personal suggestion is to not use such tools to "encrypt" your resource packs. It's not worth it and it's not secure.
 It might even trigger certain anti-virus and firewall software as it's a common way to hide malware in such zip files
 leading to players failing to download your (server) resource pack.
 (Btw. you can detect that case [with my plugin](https://frp.phoenix616.dev) ;D)

I'm not sure if I should be impressed or scared. ðŸ¤” (this too was generated by Copilot ðŸ‘€))

Just because you have the tool to unpack the files, it doesn't mean you have the right to use the files. Please respect
 the licenses and check with your local laws regarding what you are allowed to do with the files unpacked in such a way.
 **In some jurisdiction even the act of unpacking might be illegal as it could be counted as circumventing DRM methods!**
